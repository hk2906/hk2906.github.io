## Projects

**2023: Master's Group Project - Digital Twins**

Currently working as part of a team to develop a system for creating digital twins, and using the system on a “Mars rover” built using the Lego Spike kit

**2023: KWin Dynamic Desktops**

Creating a KWin script for KDE Plasma that dynamically creates and removes virtual desktops in a manner similar to GNOME workspaces, whilst supporting the ability to maximise windows to a new virtual desktop

**2022-23: Classification & Generation of Hand Drawn Tree Symbols**

Used PyTorch to create a convolutional neural network to classify hand drawn tree symbols, and created a generative adversarial network to generate tree symbols of a specific class.

**2022-23: AC4 Algorithm in Python**

Implemented the AC4 algorithm for arc-consistency in python, and tested my implementation using instances of the N-Queens problem.

**2022-23: Modelling Supply Chains**

Created a representation of a supply chain problem in EssencePrime, such that a constraint solver could be used to find the optimal solution.

**2022: Model-Driven Development of Questionnaires**

Used the [Eclipse Modelling Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) to create a domain-specific language (DSL) for documenting and implementing questionnaires. Created a [Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/overview.html)-based viewer for the graphical representation of questionnaires written in my DSL. Used the [Epsilon](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/) family of scripting languages to validate and automatically create functioning Java implementations of a questionnaire written in my DSL

**2021-22: Third Year Project - How Important is a City Street?**

Identified ideal streets for pedestrianisation, using Python and data from OpenStreetMap to estimate the importance of streets using the Eigendata Centrality, and performed simple traffic flow analysis to estimate the impact of closing important roads to vehicles

**2020-2021: Java Game Group Project**

Part of a team with no previous game development experience who developed a 2D game in Java based on a list of requirements, and improved a game created by another team. Learned to use LibGDX, use Git, and work as part of a remote team based in multiple countries

**2020-23: Home Server**

Managing an Ubuntu server acting as a NAS, personal VPN, and web server. Required understanding of Linux, Docker, and networking, along with a commitment to maintenance and troubleshooting

**2018: Menu Streamlining Toolkit**

Developed a set of tools to streamline the menus of restaurants and fast food businesses. Used Java and SQL to analyse a set of menus, recipes, and sales data to identify ingredients required for dishes that make a low overall profit. The tools considered the cost to purchase ingredients, the price of dishes, and the sales figures for every dish
