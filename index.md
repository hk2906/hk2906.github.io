**2023: Master's Group Project - Mars Rover & Digital Twin**

Worked as part of a team to create a “Mars rover” using the Lego Spike kit, and a corresponding digital twin. Implemented a message system for hub-to-hub communications using Pybrick’s Bluetooth data broadcasting feature. Wrote rover logic, including an emergency stop system, using the MicroPython-based Pybricks API

**2021-22: Third Year Project - How Important is a City Street?**

Identified ideal streets for pedestrianisation, using Python and data from OpenStreetMap to estimate the importance of streets using the Eigendata Centrality, and performed simple traffic flow analysis to estimate the impact of closing important roads to vehicles

**2020-2021: Java Game Group Project**

Part of a team with no previous game development experience who developed a 2D game in Java based on a list of requirements, and improved a game created by another team. Learned to use LibGDX, use Git, and work as part of a remote team based in multiple countries
