## About Me
I am a fourth year computer science student eager to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting. As a team leader at a takeaway restaurant I gained leadership skills, and studying for my degree during the pandemic has taught me a combination of both independent and team working skills, in both an in-person and remote working setting. I am excited to continue my professional development and contribute to innovative and impactful projects.

## Projects

**2023: Master's Group Project - Digital Twins**

Currently working as part of a team to develop a system for creating digital twins, and using the system on a “Mars rover” built using the Lego Spike kit

**2023: KWin Dynamic Desktops**

Creating a KWin script for KDE Plasma that dynamically creates and removes virtual desktops in a manner similar to GNOME workspaces, whilst supporting the ability to maximise windows to a new virtual desktop

**2021: Java Game Group Project**

Part of a team with no previous game development experience who developed a 2D game in Java based on a list of requirements, and improved a game created by another team. Learned to use LibGDX, use Git, and work as part of a remote team based in multiple countries

**2020-23: Home Server**

Managing an Ubuntu server acting as a NAS, personal VPN, and web server. Required understanding of Linux, Docker, and networking, along with a commitment to maintenance and troubleshooting

**2018: Menu Streamlining**

Developed a set of tools to streamline the menus of restaurants and fast food businesses. Used Java and SQL to analyse a set of menus, recipes, and sales data to identify ingredients required for dishes that make a low overall profit. The tools considered the cost to purchase ingredients, the price of dishes, and the sales figures for every dish

## Interests

- Software development, with a focus on legibility and good documentation

- Machine learning, its possibilities for reducing workload & improving productivity, how we can further improve it, and the ethical considerations that need to be made

- Free and open source software, and the ways it allows us to take control over our digital lives

- Small Web / web0, and the possibility of decentralised technology empowering individuals without the additional problems of blockchain technology

- Good user interface design, and the need for technology to be straightforward, intuitive, and “feel right”
