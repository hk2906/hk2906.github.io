## About Me
I am a computer science graduate now working as a software developer in the rail industry. I am a member of the IET, and professionally registered as an ICT Technician, working towards IEng. Throughout my degree, and my previous work, I have worked both independently and as part of multiple teams in a variety of roles, in both in-person and remote working environments. I am excited to continue my professional development and contribute to innovative and impactful projects

## Projects

[View all projects](projects.md)

**2023-25: ORBIT - Operational Railway Business Intelligence Tool**

Took ownership of a Django project upon joining AGH which had been started by a year in industry student, led a team to design & implement further improvements necessary to prepare the software for launch, and worked with the client to lead a scheme to gather and prepare large amounts of data to be uploaded to the service. Identified further improvements and features to be added to the software after launch to improve user experience

**2023: Master's Group Project - Mars Rover & Digital Twin**

Worked as part of a team to create a “Mars rover” using the Lego Spike kit, and a corresponding digital twin. Implemented a message system for hub-to-hub communications using Pybricks' Bluetooth data broadcasting feature. Wrote rover logic, including an emergency stop system, using the MicroPython-based Pybricks API

**2021-22: Third Year Project - How Important is a City Street?**

Identified ideal streets for pedestrianisation, using Python and data from OpenStreetMap to estimate the importance of streets using the Eigendata Centrality, and performed simple traffic flow analysis to estimate the impact of closing important roads to vehicles
