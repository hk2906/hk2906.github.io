## About Me
I am a fourth year computer science student eager to apply my skills and knowledge in a professional setting. As a team leader at a takeaway restaurant I gained leadership skills, and studying for my degree during the pandemic has taught me a combination of both independent and team working skills, in both an in-person and remote working setting. I am excited to continue my professional development and contribute to innovative and impactful projects.


## Projects

**2023: Master's Group Project - Digital Twins**

Currently working as part of a team to develop a system for creating digital twins, and using the system on a “Mars rover” built using the Lego Spike kit

**2023: Parallelising Fluid Dynamics Solver**

Issued a computational fluid dynamics solver for simulating a Karman vortex street, written in C.  Created 3 parallelised versions of the program, using OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI.

**2023: KWin Dynamic Desktops**

Creating a KWin script for KDE Plasma that dynamically creates and removes virtual desktops in a manner similar to GNOME workspaces, whilst supporting the ability to maximise windows to a new virtual desktop

**2022: Model-Driven Development of Questionnaires**

- Used the [Eclipse Modelling Framework](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) to create a domain-specific language (DSL) for documenting and implementing questionnaires
- Created a [Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/overview.html)-based viewer for the graphical representation of questionnaires written in my DSL
- Used the [Epsilon](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/evl/) family of scripting languages to validate and automatically create functioning Java implementations of a questionnaire written in my DSL

**2021-22: Third Year Project - How Important is a City Street?**

Identified ideal streets for pedestrianisation, using Python and data from OpenStreetMap to estimate the importance of streets using the Eigendata Centrality, and performed simple traffic flow analysis to estimate the impact of closing important roads to vehicles

**2020-2021: Java Game Group Project**

Part of a team with no previous game development experience who developed a 2D game in Java based on a list of requirements, and improved a game created by another team. Learned to use LibGDX, use Git, and work as part of a remote team based in multiple countries

**2020-23: Home Server**

Managing an Ubuntu server acting as a NAS, personal VPN, and web server. Required understanding of Linux, Docker, and networking, along with a commitment to maintenance and troubleshooting

**2018: Menu Streamlining Toolkit**

Developed a set of tools to streamline the menus of restaurants and fast food businesses. Used Java and SQL to analyse a set of menus, recipes, and sales data to identify ingredients required for dishes that make a low overall profit. The tools considered the cost to purchase ingredients, the price of dishes, and the sales figures for every dish


## Education

## Work & Voluntary Experience

**2020 - 2022: President, Comic Society, University of York**
Lead a team to host weekly events and foster a community, both in-person and online, during a difficult period for societies.

**2017 - 2019: Team Leader, Blue Ginger, Oldham**
Managed a busy takeaway both individually and as part of a team. Co-ordinated employees, took and organised orders, prepared food, opened and closed the shop, handled large amounts of money, documented daily revenue and expenses, trained new employees, and scheduled shifts. Worked well in a busy kitchen, whilst also serving customers, and communicated clearly with staff members for whom English is a second language. Lead the team during busier periods, and ensured the whole team worked well under intense situations. Also operated the shop independently, with only a chef and a delivery driver present.
